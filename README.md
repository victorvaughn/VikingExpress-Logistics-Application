Java-based warehouse and shipment management system developed for VikingExpress as a first-semester project at Lund University (Design of Information Systems).

The system tracks warehouse capacity, stock levels, and shipment details through an easy-to-use graphical interface. Features include automatic shipment ID generation, throughput calculation, transportation loop detection, and rule-based validation.
